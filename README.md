# Multiple Linear Regression (3D visualization)üìà

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an extension of simple linear regression, where multiple independent variables are used to predict the dependent variable. The goal of this repository is to implement MLR in Python using the Scikit-learn library (a machine learning library in Python used to implement multiple linear regression models and to read, preprocess, and split data).

‚úèÔ∏èAbout Dataset.

The data used in this study were obtained from the database of Eurostat, which is the statistical office that collects data for the European Union. The analyzed data includes the following European countries (27 countries): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden. We note that the study proposes a more varied approach, taking into account different type of countries (developed and under developed), the observed period being from 2011 to 2021.This aspect leads to a large variety of values for the considered variables.

The macroeconomic indicators analyzed in this study are:

- EP (Energy productivity)
- EE (Energy efficiency)
- EM (Employment)

We are interested in understanding the relationship between the variables involved in the study in order to have a broader view of the described economic context. In this repository we will summarize the aspects regarding 3D plotting for MLR without pointing out in detail the assumptions that must be fulfilled for multiple linear regression.
